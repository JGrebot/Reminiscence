question: "When a space or a line break are mandatory ? \n
Take the declaration of multiples int on a single line as example."

After a particular char, : , = ; * ( ) [ ] { }, no space are needed, otherwise spaces or line break are needed.
  int x,y     OK\n
  intx,y      not OK\n
  int x, y    OK\n"
